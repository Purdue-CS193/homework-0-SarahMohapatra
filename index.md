# Sarah Mohapatra's First CS 193 Homework
This is my first homework using Github. I don't know a damn thing about Github. I am just tired of too many Homeworks and courses but the instructors are cool and nice. That's the only reason pushing me to attend CS193.

## Things I like about CS193

- The instructors: They are cool people and respond to my doubts on time.
- The classmates : I haven't been able to mingle a lot but I guess they must be cool too. Looking forward to make some new friends.
- The attendance quiz: I like the attendance quizzes because that means the end of the class.
